# Mathematical-model-for-the-choice-of-metrics-in-the-IEEE-802.11s-HWMP
I have been using the NS-3 simulator, in which the 802.11s protocol script is installed by default, the same that has been developed at the Institute for Information Transmission Problems in Moscow by Kirill Andreev and Pavel Boyko. So far, it has been possible to locate the algorithm where the HWMP protocol of ALM metric is calculated and processed to modify the code; thus, it allows us to manipulate the ALM parameters and include new MAC and PHY layer parameters in the calculation of new metrics. As for upcoming advances, the project intends to create a new database with the aforementioned parameters for the Application of Autoregressive Models in R, as a computer tool, to make decisions regarding the metric to be used
